Converting the entire text into uppercase or lowercase, so that the algorithm does not treat the same words in different cases as different
Tokenization: Tokenization is just the term used to describe the process of converting the normal text strings into a list of tokens i.e words that we actually want. Sentence tokenizer can be used to find the list of sentences and Word tokenizer can be used to find the list of words in strings.
Removing Noise i.e everything that isn’t in a standard number or letter.
Removing Stop words. Sometimes, some extremely common words which would appear to be of little value in helping select documents matching a user need are excluded from the vocabulary entirely. These words are called stop words
Stemming: Stemming is the process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their stem, base or root form — generally a written word form. Example if we were to stem the following words: “Stems”, “Stemming”, “Stemmed”, “and Stemtization”, the result would be a single word “stem”.
Lemmatization: A slight variant of stemming is lemmatization. The major difference between these is, that, stemming can often create non-existent words, whereas lemmas are actual words. So, your root stem, meaning the word you end up with, is not something you can just look up in a dictionary, but you can look up a lemma. Examples of Lemmatization are that “run” is a base form for words like “running” or “ran” or that the word “better” and “good” are in the same lemma so they are considered the same.
The bag-of-words is a representation of text that describes the occurrence of words within a document.
 problem with the Bag of Words approach is that highly frequent words start to dominate in the document (e.g. larger score), but may not contain as much “informational content”. Also, it will give more weight to longer documents than shorter documents.

One approach is to rescale the frequency of words by how often they appear in all documents so that the scores for frequent words like “the” that are also frequent across all documents are penalized. This approach to scoring is called Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, or TF-IDF for short, where:

Term Frequency: is a scoring of the frequency of the word in the current document.

TF = (Number of times term t appears in a document)/(Number of terms in the document)
Inverse Document Frequency: is a scoring of how rare the word is across documents.

IDF = 1+log(N/n), where, N is the number of documents and n is the number of documents a term t has appeared in.
Tf-idf weight is a weight often used in information retrieval and text mining. This weight is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus
TF-IDF is a transformation applied to texts to get two real-valued vectors in vector space. We can then obtain the Cosine similarity of any pair of vectors by taking their dot product and dividing that by the product of their norms. That yields the cosine of the angle between the vectors. Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors. Using this formula we can find out the similarity between any two documents d1 and d2.
